## Project Summary
•	Using data to show people how the usage of plastic straws has brought the severe harm to the ocean environment, and how can we stop it.

## Project Structure & Initial sketches
•	Hook and Fact: Presenting the number about how many straws are used per year, and what that number means in terms of pollution. 

•	The situation now: What has been done so far? Which countries and cities have banned the usage of plastic straws? What are public opinions on this issue?

•	Alternatives and call to action: what can we do to reduce the plastic straws pollution?

## Data Resources and Method
•	In the Hook and Fact part, I will use the US annual plastic straws usage data (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/04/plastic-straws-ocean-trash-environment/) first. Then I will show how many of these plastic straws were found on U.S. shorelines, and what plastic straws rank in the TOP 10 contributors to plastic marine debris across the globe. (https://gn.org/en/world-today/deadly-facts-about-plastic-straws) (https://sloactive.com/plastic-pollution/) Also, I will present how plastic pollution can harm the marine creatures(http://strawwars.org/).

•	To point out the situation now, I will show what countries and cities that have taken action to ban the plastic straws(https://www.aza.org/from-the-desk-of-dan-ashe/posts/how-do-straws-hurt-the-environment). Besides, I will present the general public’s opinion on this issue.( https://morningconsult.com/2018/08/02/poll-us-adults-support-companies-phase-out-plastic-straws/)

•	As for the call to action, I will use infographic to show some of alternatives that we can use instead of the plastic straws.

### Method
•	I will use Shorthand to build my story in a non-linear manner. Elements that I will use to tell my story are: Infographic, data visualization, and some key stats with short paragraphs of description.
