# Final Project:
## Design concept of my final project
The intended audience for my final project: Collecting Michelin Stars with Data is all Heinz College students who are going to Network in New York on the week of October 14. I know I’m going to present in a room with all my classmates, so I choose to pick a topic that is relatively relevant to them. Also, it helps me to develop the storyline of the project. First, I give an overall introduction about exactly how many Michelin restaurants are there in New York City. Then, since my audience is all students, I decided to narrow down the topic to introduce only one-star Michelin restaurants in the city.

The overarching goal of my project is to help my classmates to find cheap one-star Michelin restaurants in NYC and provide them the information that they can really use in real life. Therefore, I categorized the restaurants I found into several categories — for example, type of cuisine, overall ranking, number of reviews, and their locations. At the end of my data visualization story, I made a QR code which will navigate my audience to the google map and get a full list of restaurants that I have recommended in my data visualization story. 

## Key Takeaways
The most important thing that I learned from the class is how important it is to know the characteristic of dataset that you are going to visualize. I found that every time when I started to do a new assignment, if I thought about the design process first, I would not be able to create the visualization very efficiently. Instead, if I took time to analyzed the characteristic of the dataset first, then I could know what I should visualize these data easily.
